# Cars Machine Learning Project

## Mandatory Assignment 1

**For your Mandatory Assignment 1 you must do the following**:

- obtain the cars.csv file from the course materials folder in the course materials repository
- using the dataset found in the file, complete the tasks below:
  - formulate a regression problem
  - formulate a logistic regression problem
  - design and train a model for each of the regression and logistic regression problems
  - fine tune your models
  - answer your problem formulations
  - write a max two page research article (in [Latex](https://gitlab.com/keaorg/kea-aai-latex-demo)) with relevant visuals

**Submit the following to the [code share repository](https://gitlab.com/keaorg/kea-aai-codeshare-2025-2)**:
- article in PDF
- all project files, including notebooks, .tex file, etc.

Follow the directions for submission in the assignments repository README.md file.

Your submission should not include large datasets, but clearly document how to obtain such files if necessary.

**Part 1**: project as listed above, due **October 24, 08:00 morning**.

**Part 2**: peer review of two other groups, due **October 31, 08:00 morning**.

## Column descriptions in Car dataset

| Column Name     | What It Means                                                                 |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **mpg**         | *Miles per gallon* — a measure of fuel efficiency. Higher values = better fuel economy. |
| **cylinders**   | Number of cylinders in the engine. More cylinders often mean more power, but lower fuel efficiency. |
| **displacement**| Engine size in cubic inches. Larger displacement usually means a more powerful engine. |
| **horsepower**  | The engine’s power output. Higher horsepower = faster acceleration and higher speed potential. |
| **weight**      | Vehicle weight in pounds. Heavier cars may be less fuel-efficient and slower to accelerate. |
| **acceleration**| Time (in seconds) to go from 0 to 60 mph. Lower values = quicker acceleration. |
| **model year**  | The year the car model was released. In your data, it's coded as two digits (e.g., 70 = 1970). |
| **origin**      | Country of origin: `1` = USA, `2` = Europe, `3` = Japan |
| **car name**    | The full name of the car, including brand and model. Useful for identification or grouping. |

## Problem formulations

### Regression Problem Example

**Goal**: Predict a car’s **acceleration time (seconds from 0 to 60 mph)** based on its physical and mechanical characteristics.

**Problem Statement**:  
> *Given features like `cylinders`, `displacement`, `horsepower`, `weight`, and `acceleration`, predict how long it takes a car to acclerate from 0 to 60 mph.*

**Why it works**:  
- *Acceleration* is a continuous numeric variable, making this a **multiple linear regression** problem.  
- The chosen features (**weight**, **horsepower**, **displacement**, **cylinders**) are quantitative predictors known to influence vehicle performance.  
- The model aims to capture the relationship between a car’s power-to-weight characteristics and its acceleration capability.  


**Example input row**:
```csv
3200,130,250,6
```
**Predicted output**:
```csv
10.8 -> Acceleration
```

### Logistic Regression Problem Example

**Goal**: Classify whether a car is **American-made** or **foreign-made**.

**Problem Statement**:  
> *Using features like `cylinders`, `displacement`, `horsepower`, `weight`, and `acceleration`, predict whether the car's `origin` is 1 (USA) or not (foreign).*

**Why it works**:  
- You convert `origin` into a binary label:  
  - `1` → American  
  - `0` → Foreign (i.e., origin = 2 or 3)
- Logistic regression is ideal for binary classification.
- You can analyze which features most influence whether a car is American-made.

**Example input row**:
```csv
4,113,95,2372,15
```
**Predicted output**:
```csv
0 → Foreign-made
```
